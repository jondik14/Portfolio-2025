## Purpose

Reduce token usage and avoid unintended changes.

## Global Rules

- Do not read or modify files unless explicitly named
- Do not scan the entire repo
- Make small, targeted changes only
- Ask before creating new files or folders
- Do not refactor unless asked

## Model Behaviour

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid long explanations
- If unsure, ask a question before acting
- If stuck, stop instead of looping

## Output Rules

- When coding, output code only
- When explaining, keep it short
